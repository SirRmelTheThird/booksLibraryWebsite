                    <p title="Desc">Overworked, mistreated animals on a farm revolt and take control over it. They set out to create an ideal space brimming with the ideas of progress, justice, and equality only to result in an equally problematic environment. This makes the backdrop of one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, this book chronicles the evolution from revolution against tyranny to totalitarianism just as terrible. An allegory on the Soviet regime, Animal Farm was banned in the Eastern bloc and is one of the great political works of the 20th Century.</p>

Clinging to each other in their loneliness and alienation, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie dream, as drifters will, of a place to call their own. But after they come to work on a ranch in the Salinas Valley their hopes, like "the best laid schemes o' mice an' men", begin to go awry. "A thriller, a gripping tale ... that you will not set down until it is finished. Steinbeck has touched the quick."</p>
